# image-processing2
additional code beyond the assignment image processing to take any 1,2,or 3 images and allow the user to direct the computer how to manipulate the images rather than taking a set path
the example pictures were the desired pictures from the image processing repository file 
the rest of the images are the given images that can be manipulated
